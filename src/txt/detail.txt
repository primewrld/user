So I heard some of us don't understand the assignment, Let me recap.

- Create a Profile Component.
- The profile component should receive a prop that holds a user array (This is an array of user objects with three keys, Name, Boi/description, and DateOfBirth)
- The Profile page needs to have a component named UserDetails for rendering each user's details.
- The UserDetails component should receive a prop for each user. e,g pass a prop named "user" to the UserDetails component.
- You should utilize the map method to map over users on the profile page and then pass each user as a prop to UserDetails.
- The UserDetails should receive those props and then render the details of that particular user.
- Remember to use "useEffect" to set users to a state variable on the first page load. I showed an example in class and also gave a boilerplate code

This assignment is open-ended so you can do it as you choose but be sure you do it efficiently.




In this implementation:

The Profile component receives a prop users, which is an array of user objects.
The UserDetails component receives a prop user which contains the details of a particular user.
The useEffect hook in the Profile component sets the initial state of the userList using the users prop.
The map method is used to iterate over each user in the userList state and render the UserDetails component for each user.
Example usage is provided at the end, where the Profile component is rendered with usersData as the prop.
